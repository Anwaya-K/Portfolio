	<h3>Project 1 : Forensic Management System</h3>
           
         <h4>Description of the Project</h4>
	<p>Problem Statement : Forensic Management System shows how the actions of police at a crime scene can affect the availability and 
        efficacy of forensic tests later in the investigation. 
        The purpose of crime scene management is to control, preserve, record, and recover evidence from the scene of an incident. 
        Any evidence removed from a scene by investigators must be packaged and labelled correctly to prevent injury and contamination.
        Once forensic analysis begins, it is important to ensure that the questions asked are investigative and not purely scientific.
        It is sometimes useful to bring the forensic specialist to the crime scene itself
